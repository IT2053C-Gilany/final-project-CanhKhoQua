IT2053C – Data Tech Programming  
By: Loc Nguyen

---

This project analyzes fruit and vegetable prices using Python and data visualization techniques. The goal is to explore pricing trends, compare fresh vs processed fruits, and apply data analysis skills learned throughout the course.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This final project consists of **three main parts**:

1. **Initiation (Part 1)** – Project planning and dataset selection  
2. **Notebook (Part 2)** – Full data analysis in Jupyter Notebook  
3. **Presentation (Part 3)** – Final video presentation  

The main analysis is completed in the file:

- `final-project.ipynb`

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

This project uses a **Conda environment** named `IT2053C`.

### 1. Create the Environment (If Needed)

```bash
python scripts/setup.py --username <your_6+2_username>
```
✅ Example:
```bash
python scripts/setup.py --username nguye2lc
```
### 2. Activate the Environment
Now, you can activate the environment in the terminal by running the following command:

```bash
# Activate your conda environment
conda activate IT2053C
```
### 3. Required Libraries
In this project, we'll utilize these libraries for technical use
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- scipy
- pathlib
### 4. Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into the following sections:
1. Title and Executive Summary
2. Data Card
3. Loading and File IO
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Conclusion
6. Appendix: Resources and References  
Each main section also contains relevant **sub-headings** to further organize the analysis and results.

## 📊 Key Research Questions
- How do prices vary among different fruits?
- What is the average price of Fresh fruits?
- Are fresh fruits more expensive than non-fresh forms?
- How do prices vary among 4 different berries (Blackberries, Blueberries, Raspberries, and Strawberries) across their Fresh and Frozen forms?
- What is the correlation between RetailPrice and CupEquivalentPrice?
- What patterns exist in prices across different fruit forms?
- What is the distribution of fruit forms in this dataset?

## ✅ Final Submission Includes
✔ Jupyter Notebook (final-project.ipynb)  
✔ GitHub Repository  
✔ Presentation Video
